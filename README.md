# hello-world
This is going to be my first repository and actually first steps on programming and github.
Here I have to tell something about me. Idk what to say, I'm Diego, I'm 19 right now, I'm from Bogota, Colombia and I am wishing to learn how to code. I have code before on Minecraft, Scratch and I have also modeled on SketchUp. That's it for now.
